# Design Patterns and Engineering Decisions

- **Thread-per-client model** for concurrent client handling
- **Separation of concerns** between networking logic and GUI logic
- **Event-driven UI updates** using SwingUtilities for thread safety
- **Coordinator role pattern** for lightweight distributed coordination

The system prioritises clarity and robustness over complexity.
